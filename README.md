# Cordova Tools Extension

Debug your code, find commands in the Command Palette, and use IntelliSense to browse objects, functions, and parameters in plugin APIs. This extension works with any Cordova-based project.

## Install it

Click the **Get Started** button on this page.

You'll also have to do a few more things:

1. Open a Terminal (on a Mac) or a Command Prompt (on a Windows computer).
2. Run `npm install -g cordova`
3. If you're planning on targeting iOS devices,
 * Install [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) on your Mac.
 * Open a Terminal and run `brew install ideviceinstaller ios-webkit-debug-proxy`

## Add a platform to your Cordova project

Open a Terminal or a Command Prompt and run the following command in the root directory of your project

`cordova platform add android`

Supported platforms: `android, ios`

## Choose the Cordova debug environment

Click the debug icon (![Choose Cordova debugger](images/debug-view-icon.png)) in the View bar, and then click the configure gear icon (![Configure-gear](images/configure-gear-icon.png)) to choose the Cordova debug environment.

![Choose Cordova debugger](images/choose-debugger.png)

The launch configuration file appears. It contains some default configurations such as what is shown below.

![Cordova launch configuration file](images/launch-config.png)

You can modify these configurations or add new ones to the list. Just don't add a Windows or a Browser configuration as they are not supported yet.

You can use other fields in these configurations as well. Here's the complete list:

Name                               | Description                                                                                                                                   | Defaults
---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ---------
`port`                             | The port number that the debugger uses to connect to a device or emulator.                                                                    | 9222
`sourceMaps`                       | Set this field to `true` if you want the debugger to use javascript sourcemaps (if they exist).                                               | false
`webkitRangeMin`, `webkitRangeMax` | Combines to specify the port range that you want the debugger to use to find the specific device or simulator described in the configuration. | 9223, 9322
`attachAttempts`                   | The maximum number of times that you want the debugger to attempt to attach to a running iOS app.                                             | 5
`attachDelay`                      | The time in milliseconds between each attempt to attach to a running iOS application.                                                         | 1000
`iosDebugProxyPort`                | The port number that you want the debugger to use when it launches iOS applications on a device.                                              | 9221
`appStepLaunchTimeout`             | The maximum time in milliseconds allowed for each individual step the debugger takes to launch an iOS app on a device.                        | 5000
`ionicLiveReload`                  | Set to true to enable Ionic live reload                                                                                                       | false
`devServerAddress`                 | For Ionic live reload scenario specify the IP address the device can use to contact the Ionic server                                          | n/a
`devServerPort`                    | For Ionic live reload scenario specify the port the device can use to contact the Ionic server                                                | n/a


## Debug your Cordova-based project

To start the debugger, choose a target from the target drop-down list, and then either click the start button (![Configure-gear](images/debug-icon.png)) or press F5.

![Cordova launch targets](images/debug-targets.png)

You can debug your app on an Android emulator, iOS simulator, or a device. If you have your app running in one already, you can attach the debugger to it. The debugger uses the application ID of your project to locate the running instance.

We won't go into all of the great things that you can do with the Visual Studio Code debugger, but you can read about it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

> **Troubleshooting tip:**
If you receive an error stating that ADB is not recognized as an internal or external command, you'll have to update your path variable to include the location of your *ADB* executable file. The *ADB* executable file is located in a subfolder along with your other Android SDK files. For example, on a Windows computer, the location of the *ADB* executable file would likely be here: ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools```.

## Find Cordova commands in the Command Palette

In the Command Palette, type ```Cordova``` and choose a command.

![Cordova commands](images/command-palette.png)

There are only a couple of them for now but that list will grow.

The **Build** command triggers ```cordova build``` and builds for all platforms that you've added to the project.

Since all platforms are built you may receive errors for incompatible configurations.
For example, if you're on a Windows computer, and you've added an iOS platform to your project, you'll get an error because you need a Mac to build for iOS platforms. You can't build an iOS app on a Mac by using VSCode on a Windows computer.

The ```Run``` command triggers `cordova run` and starts your app without debugging and just like the **Build** command, it runs *all* platforms that you've added to your project.

## Support for Ionic

* The debug target includes the ability to serve to the browser for use with Ionic projects. You can now deploy and debug directly to Chrome, live reload is enabled by default.

* We've included a number of useful JavaScript and HTML code snippets for your project, try typing `ion_` in the editor to see what's available.

![JavaScript snippets](images/ionic_javascript_snippet.png)
![HTML snippets](images/ionic_html_snippet.png)

* New Ionic commands have also been added to the Command Palette, type `Ionic` in the palette to see the full list.

* Ionic live reload is supported on devices and emulators.

* Additional IntelliSense has been added for Ionic, Angular and JQuery.

## Use IntelliSense with Plugin APIs

Intellisense helps you discover objects, functions, and parameters in libraries that your project consumes. Now you can use it for the more popularly used *core* plugins.

![IntelliSense](images/intellisense.png)

IntelliSense appears only for plugins that you've added to your project, but it doesn't matter whether you add the plugin before or after you install this extension.

Just start typing in the code editor to see the objects, functions, and parameters of your plugin's API.
